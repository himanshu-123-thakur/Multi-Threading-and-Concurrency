/*
Using try窶田atch with threads ensures exception safety and prevents program crashes. When a thread is created using std::thread, 
it must be either join()ed or detach()ed before the thread object is destroyed. If an exception occurs and you are not using a 
try窶田atch block, the control may exit the function before join() is called. In such a case, the thread remains joinable, and its
 destructor calls std::terminate(), causing the program to crash. By using a try窶田atch, you can call join() inside the catch block 
 before rethrowing the exception, ensuring the thread is cleaned up properly and the program remains stable. Without try窶田atch, any
unexpected exception can skip cleanup and lead to abrupt termination.
